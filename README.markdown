j2k.js
======

This is a port of OpenJPEG, an open-source JPEG2000 codec, to JavaScript using Emscripten.

Why? JPEG2000 is useful sometimes, and web browsers don't have native support for it, so having
a pure JS decoder is a nice option to have.


Usage
-----

Grab openjpeg.js which is an optimized and minified build. Then you simply call

```
    openjpeg([..])
```
with the argument being an array of values in 0-255 (representing a j2k file in binary format).
The function returns a a JSON object of form

```
    {
      width: the width
      height: the height
      data: the pixel data (in 24-bit RGB format)
    }
```

For examples of usage, see the bundled directory:

+ `examples/`


Building
--------

(You don't normally need to do this.)

Do

```
    python make.py
```

Looks like you need |make clean| in build/ as incremental builds do not always link.

Testing
-------

Run

```
    python test.py openjpeg.js
```
